Write a function, connectedComponentsCount, that takes in the adjacency list of an undirected graph. The function should return the number of connected components within the graph.

connectedComponentsCount({
  0: [8, 1, 5],
  1: [0],
  5: [0, 8],
  8: [0, 5],
  2: [3, 4],
  3: [2, 4],
  4: [3, 2]
}); // output -> 2
