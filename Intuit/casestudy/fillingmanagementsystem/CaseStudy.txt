Problem Statement: 

    #Fuel Station Challenge

    Fuel Station has 2 petrol and 2 diesel stations. The station has 2 employees who can shuttle to fill fuel. 
    During peak vehicles line up at each of the station based on the shortest line.
    How can you design a filling management system so that all the vehicles are treated fairly by the employees?
    Assume it takes 1 second to fill every vehicle and also some vehciles like ambulance get first priority.

    Method 1 -> Add 20/many vehicles to station based on fuel type in memory
    Method 2 -> Add one vehicle based on the fuel type and measure how long it takes for the service

    #Expectations

    Readable, modularized code with clear separation of concerns
    Code to be testable, easy to add new modification
    Clean interfaces, interactions
    Efficiency and Scale Patterns
    Data Structures
    Reusability, extensibility
    Correct business logic
    Observability
    State assumptions
    Look out for methods like
    method 1 -> Add 20/many vehicles to station based on fuel type
    method 2 -> Add one vehicle based on the fuel type and measure how long it takes for the service
